# Ansible Role: PHP PECL extensions

[![CI](https://github.com/geerlingguy/ansible-role-php-pecl/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/geerlingguy/ansible-role-php-pecl/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

Installs PHP PECL extensions (and optionally `pecl` itself) on servers with PHP already installed.

## Requirements

PHP must already be installed on the server. This role works great with and is tested alongside `geerlingguy.php`.

Also, if you don't already have `php-pear` (RedHat) or `php-pecl` (Debian) installed, you should set `php_pecl_install_pecl: true` to force this role to install the proper package.

## Role Variables

Available variables are listed below, along with default values (see `defaults/main.yml`):

    php_pecl_install_pecl: false

Whether to install `php-pecl` (Debian-based OSes) or `php-pear` (RedHat-based OSes).

    php_pecl_install_command: "pecl install"

The command that will be run to install extensions. The default is generally correct, but if you're running Ubuntu 14.04 LTS and run into [this issue](https://github.com/geerlingguy/ansible-role-php-pecl/pull/7), you should override this default with `"pecl install -Z"`

    php_pecl_extensions: []

A list of extensions that should be installed via `pecl install`. If you'd like to have this role install extensions like XDebug, just add it in the list, like so:

    php_pecl_extensions:
      - redis
      - xdebug
